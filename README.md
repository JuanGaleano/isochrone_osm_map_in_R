# isochrone_osm_map_in_R

I generally don't create GithHub repositories on demand, but yesterday I published a map on BlueSky and Michel Friendly asked about the blended color palette I have used. 
I have used articles and materials from Dr. Friendly in my dataviz and Digital Cartography classes so manyÂ times, that it's impossible to say no in this case.

You can see the map in question below.

## Context 

Every year I teach a course in Harbour Space university, in Bangkok, called "From Data to Knowledge". The course is devote to introduce bachelor and master students in Data Science to some of the most common techniques for visualizing statistical data and producing Digital Cartgoraphy. In session 8 we review how to access Open Street Maps data from R, how to geocode indformation and how to access the OpenRouteService from OSM. 

## Here you have a gpt-generated explanation of what is OpenRouteService     
OpenRouteService (ORS) is a powerful open-source routing platform that provides route planning and geospatial analysis services. It is built on top of OpenStreetMap (OSM) data and is designed for developers, researchers, and organizations that need routing and geospatial functionalities. Here are its main features and applications:

**Main Features**     

**Route Planning:** Provides optimized routes for various modes of transportation, such as driving, walking, cycling, wheelchair, and public transport.
Offers different types of routing profiles, including fastest, shortest, or environmentally friendly routes.            

**Isochrones:** Generates areas that can be reached within a certain time or distance from a specific location, useful for accessibility analysis.     

**Geocoding:** Converts addresses into geographic coordinates (forward geocoding) and vice versa (reverse geocoding).     

**Matrix Routing:** Calculates travel times or distances between multiple points, commonly used for logistics and delivery optimization.     

**Directions:** Provides turn-by-turn directions for navigation, including detailed steps, distances, and estimated travel times.      

**Accessibility Analysis:** Identifies areas that can be accessed within a certain time/distance under specific transportation conditions, helping in urban planning or service accessibility.      

**How It Works**     

ORS is powered by OpenStreetMap, which provides free and up-to-date geographic data.
The platform offers an API for integration into custom applications or workflows.
It can be accessed through their web interface or installed locally for private use.
